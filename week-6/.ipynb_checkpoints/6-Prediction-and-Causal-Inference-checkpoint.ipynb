    "# Week 6 - Prediction & Causal Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, we covered the classification of text, such as classifying Reddit posts by thread topic. Classification often uses a representative sample of the text that we want to make inferences about, such as if we can human-code only a random sample of texts and then use ML to classify the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we talk about two different types of inferences to out-of-sample populations. _Text as Data_ defines _prediction_ by the question: \"What value of the outcome do we expect for a unit or units out of a distinct population of units?\" Often this is prediction for the future. We don't expect the weather today to be identical to the weather tomorrow, but it should contain some useful information. They define _causal inference_ by the question: \"How do outcomes differ if we intervene in the world?\" Causality is a deeply contested notion in science and philosophy, but it usually involves an \"if,\" a different between two counterfactual worlds, one where an event occurs and one where it doesn't.\n",

    "# Prediction\n",
    "We can make predictions about a range of different populations of texts. We can use texts in English to predict their translated version in French. We can use newspaper articles from 2012 to 2022 to predict 2023 newspaper articles (e.g., a [time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series)). Instead of forecasting, we can \"nowcast\" by using real-time social information such as Tweets to predict when an important event is happening, such as a riot.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we don't have any information about how the new population will vary from the population we learned from, then prediction is implemented in the same way as in-sample inference. For example, if you have a categorization of 2022 emails as spam or not, you could predict whether 2023 emails are spam the same way you predicted 2022 emails. On the other hand, if you have new information, such as a trend beginning in December 2022 for spam emails to have \"Urgent:\" in the subject line, your 2023 prediction may differ by putting more weight on that indicator relative to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "We currently don't have code for this, because it's so similar to the classification last week, but we encourage you to think more about this if you're interested in predicting the future of your corpus!"

    "# Text in causal inference\n",
    "\n",
    "In causal inference, we are interested in the effect of a _treatment_ on an _outcome_. There are five sorts of variables that could be directly involved in our causal model, and any of them could be a text variable. This figure from [Keith et al. 2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.474.pdf) concisely shows the five positions for variables in acyclic (i.e., no arrows flow back into themselves) causal inference: treatment, mediator, outcome, confounder, and collider.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UChicago-Computational-Content-Analysis/Homework-Notebooks/main/week-6/img/causal_diagram.png\" alt=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UChicago-Computational-Content-Analysis/Homework-Notebooks/main/week-6/img/causal_diagram.png\" style=\"width:500px\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Text as treatment\" means the effect of text on other variables. For example, how does the news coverage of a politician affect their election chance? How does the sentiment of a Reddit post affect its upvotes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether we're interested in text as treatment, mediator, outcome, or confounder, we have at our disposal the same causal inference strategies used with other forms of data, such as matching, difference in difference, regression discontinuity, and instrumental variable. Each of these methods usually gives you a more precise identification of the causal effect than a plain regression. For example, one of the readings for this week, [Saha 2019](https://doi.org/10.1145/3292522.3326032), uses propensity score matching, which is a straightforward method that works on most datasets but has relatively weak identification. Some scholars such as Gary King advocate for an improved method, [coarsened exact matching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvMyjDi4dyg). However, for this assignment, we do not go into these methods. We only use simple regressions. There are several courses at UChicago that introduce these methods, as well as online textbooks like Scott Cunningham's [Causal Inference: The Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/), which is geared towards economists.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do causal inference on any sort of text data as long as you have a plausible _identification_ strategy, meaning an argument that you can correctly identify a causal effect if one exists using your data and analysis. For example, if you have a data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) where you intervene randomly with some treatment, you can identify a causal effect with relative ease."

    "Now we have 1,346 triples of quote-response1-response2, several text variables of response1 (e.g., \"Is the respondent using sarcasm?\") that may predict the agreement of response2. In other words: _Does a sarcastic comment lead to more agreement?_ Of course, as with almost all observational data, there are a number of confounders that make our identification difficult, but for now, let's see how to run a simple regression in Python of agreement_r2 (dependent variable, commonly known as Y) on sarcasm_r1. Fortunately, we do have a strong case for identifying the direction of causality: Because response1 comes before response2, we can rule out the possibility that response2 affects response1."

Note that the coefficients are both positive: For attack_r1/nicenasty_r1, this means that a more \"supportive/respectful\" comment led to more agreement, and for sarcasm_r1, this means that a more sarcasistic comment led to more agreement!

This sort of robustness or sensitivity analysis is important for making sure your finding is compelling to yourself and to your audience. Consider doing other robustness checks, such as standardizing these variables before running the regression or adding [robust standard errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteroscedasticity-consistent_standard_errors). (To put a finer point on it, the analysis above would probably not be sufficient for a peer-reviewed journal, especially as proof of a causal effect.)"

If you are using social media data for your final project, we encourage you to classify or annotate that data (either compuationally or with human annotators) and look at the effect of texts on replies to that text (e.g., Reddit posts on Reddit comments, Tweets on Twitter replies, YouTube video transcripts on YouTube comments).

    "Above, we used a number of external measures of text, meaning that the measures were developed without any influence from this dataset. For the annotations, it was Mechanical Turk workers measuring the text. For length, that is just a mathematical count of characters. For sentiment, that BERT model was not trained on this Internet Arguments Corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this is not always the case. Consider if we want to make a measure of the text based on topic modeling. We build an LDA topic model of these comments, then we measure what number of words from Topic 1 each comment uses. Can we put that measure in the regression? Unfortunately it would lead to a biased estimate of the true effect size because our measure is no longer external. The measure and the model are double-dipping the textual information. This is important to keep in mind for your final projects, and for a more thorough explanation and justification, you can read more about this in [Egami et al. 2018](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.02163.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to this in the Internet Arguments Corpus would be to build the measures with the `pairs` that were not also `triples`. Sometimes we have excess data like this that is similar enough to our regression data, which we can use without reducing our regression sample size. For example, you could abductively generate a keyword-count measure like \"argumentativeness\" or \"thoughtfulness\" from non-triple pairs that isn't already in the annotations, and then count the keywords in the triples. This would avoid contamination."

Let's briefly return to the Internet Arguments Corpus triples and model the effect of the first comment (\"quote\") on the third comment (\"response2\") mediated by the second comment (\"response1\").

If we didn't, we might correctly find that the treatment and outcome are correlated, but rather than one causing the other, they could both be caused by a third variable. For example, if we are studying the effect of the journal a paper is published in on the citations of the paper, we may be worried that the text of the article affects both whether it is published by the journal and whether people cite it.\n",

    "The factors we controlled for in the Internet Arguments Corpus could be seen as confounders, but there are also specific methods to control for text confounders.
