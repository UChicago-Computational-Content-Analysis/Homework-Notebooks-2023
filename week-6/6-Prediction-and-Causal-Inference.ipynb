    "# Week 6 - Prediction & Causal Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Last week, we explored (supervised) text classification, where we train a model to learn associations between text and some classification or value connected with it (e.g., what distinguishes a winning argument before the Supreme Court; can we extend our judgment regarding what documents are relevant to my thesis project to all of Google News; etc.) Classification often uses a representative sample of text about which we want to make inferences and then we use machine learning to learn \"true\" assignments and classify the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, we explore two different types of inferences to out-of-sample populations. _Prediction_ involves our reasoned expectation regarding an unobserved state of the world, given the world in which we live and on which we have trained our prediction algorithm. Often this prediction is about the future world. We don't expect the U.S. Congress to talk about the identical things today and tomorrow, but today should contain some useful information. by contrast _causal inference_ poses the related by distinct challenge of our reasoned expectations regarding an unobserved state of the world IF we intervene in some way. In other words, what does the intervention cause, and how can we predict it to change the world. Causality has a deeply contested history in social science and philosophy, but it usually involves an \"if,\" a difference between two counterfactual worlds, one where an event occurs and one where it doesn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "Causal questions in text analysis may place the text in one or more of many positions we explore below: as cause, effect, confounder, mediator (or moderator), or collider. For example, assuming that everything spoken can be transcribed into text, saying something mean might hurt someone's feelings (text as cause). Doing something mean might cause someone to say something angry (text as effect). Apologizing might change the influence of doing something mean (text as mediator/moderator). A compliment might obscure the effect of doing something mean (text as confounder). And yelling something audaciously mean might yield a loud, emotional response, which both influence the likelihood that the interaction was recorded and subjected to analysis (text as collider). As you can see, in a single conversation, text can play all of these roles. Why do we care about cause and effect with text? Because while words appear to exert power in the world, which words spoken under what circumstances by whom? Causal analysis attempts to get at the question, if _X_ was written or spoken, _Y_ would happen."

    "# Prediction\n",
    "We can make predictions about a range of different text 'populations'. We can use texts in English to predict their translations in French. We can use newspaper articles from 2012 to 2022 to forecast the contents of 2023 newspaper articles (e.g., a [time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series)). Or we can \"nowcast\" by using real-time social information such as Tweets to predict when an important event is happening, such as a riot.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we don't have any information about how the new population will vary from the population we modeled, then prediction is implemented in the same way as in-sample inference. E.g., if you have a categorization of 2022 emails as spam or ham, you could predict whether 2023 emails are spam the same way you predicted 2022 emails. On the other hand, if you have new information, such as a trend beginning in December 2022 for spam emails to have \"Urgent:\" in the subject line, your 2023 prediction may differ by putting more weight on that indicator relative to others.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, prediction is similar to the classifications we performed last last week, incorporating multidimensional trends (e.g., time, place, source) learnable from your current corpus. We encourage you to think more about this if you are interested in predicting the future of your corpus!"

    "# Text in causal inference\n",
    "\n",
    "In causal inference, we are interested in the effect of a _treatment_ on an _outcome_. There are five types of variables that could be directly involved in our causal model, and any could be a text variable. This figure from [Keith et al. 2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.474.pdf) concisely shows the five positions for variables in acyclic (i.e., no arrows flow back into themselves) causal inference: treatment, mediator, outcome, confounder, and collider.\n",

    "\n",
    "\"Text as treatment\" means the effect of text on other variables. For example, how does the news coverage of a politician affect their election chance? How does the sentiment of a Reddit post affect its upvotes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether we're interested in text as treatment, mediator, outcome, or confounder, we have at our disposal the same causal inference strategies used with other forms of data, such as matching, difference in difference, regression discontinuity, and instrumental variables. Each of these methods usually gives you a more precise conditional identification of the causal influence than regressing an effect on a singular (purported) cause. For example, one of the readings for this week, [Saha 2019](https://doi.org/10.1145/3292522.3326032), uses propensity score matching, which is a straightforward method that works on most datasets (see Professor Gary King on [coarsened exact matching](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tvMyjDi4dyg)). For this assignment, we do not detail each of these causal strategies, but note several courses at UChicago that introduce these methods, as well as online textbooks (e.g., Scott Cunningham's [Causal Inference: The Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do causal inference on any sort of text data as long as you have a plausible _identification_ strategy, meaning an argument that you can correctly identify a causal effect if one exists using your data and analysis. For example, if you have a data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) where you intervene randomly with some treatment, you can identify a causal effect with relative ease. Text exhibits a wide array of dependencies making unconditional randomization impossible, but we will attempt strategies that approach it. "
