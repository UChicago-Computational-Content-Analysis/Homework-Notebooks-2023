Most recording systems use a $2^{16} = 65536$ bit system. Quantisation is a rounding process, where high bit quantisation produces values close to reality with values rounded to a high number of significant digits, and low bit quantisation produces values further from reality with values rounded a low number of significants digits. Low quantisation can lead to impaired quality signal. <img src=\"../data/bitrate.png\"> This figure illustrates how digital sounds is a discrete process along the amplitude scale: a 3 bit, $2^3=8$, quantization (gray bars) gives a rough approximation of the sin wave (red line)."

    "\n",
    "Today, most state of the art methods involving audio uses deep learning methods to embed audio in a high dimensional space - similar to some of the methods we have seen before for text. While earlier methods for speech feature extraction and classification used audio features such as some of what we saw earlier in this notebook (frequencies), as well as power (via the [Mel-frequency cepstrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum) coefficients), the success of word2vec quickly inspired [speech2vec](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08976.pdf) method to use these features to construct semantically coherent vectors. This was a jump from the acoustic and phenome based vectors previously calculated. Further work has lead to state-of-the-art wav2vec2, which we will explore in this section. We will be revisiting the Transformers package we saw last week, this time using them to load pre-trained wav2vec2 models for both creating a vector representation to making a transcription. In the example below we use a sample from librispeech, which is also what this model was trained on."

    "\n",
    "Recall our earlier use of scikit-learn for machine learning. Now we will use scikit-image to do some simple image processing. Here we will perform three operations for 'blob' of simple object detection. In computer vision, blob detection methods aim to detect regions in a digital image that differ in properties, such as brightness or color, compared to surrounding regions. Informally, a blob is a region of an image in which some properties are approximately constant or similar to each other. We will do this in three ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will take the Laplacian of an image, which is a 2-D isotropic (applying equally well in all directions) measure of the 2nd spatial derivative of an image. The Laplacian of an image highlights regions of rapid intensity change and is therefore often used for edge detection. This Laplacian is taken of the image once a Gaussian smoothing filter has been applied in order to reduce its sensitivity to noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Laplacian $L(x,y)$ of an image with pixel intensity values $I(x,y)$ is given by: $L(x,y)=\\frac{\\delta^2x}{\\delta x^2} + \\frac{\\delta^2y}{\\delta y^2}$. A Gaussian smoothing filter takes a 2 dimensional Guassian, $G(x,y)=\\frac{1}{2 \\pi \\sigma^2} e^\\frac{-x^2 + y^2}{2\\sigma^2}$, which looks like: <img src=\"http://www.librow.com/content/common/images/articles/article-9/2d_distribution.gif\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This Gaussian *kernel* is applied to the pixel intensities of the image via *convolution* -- the kernel is multiplied by the pixel intensities, while centered on each pixel, then added.\n",
    "\n",
    "The blob detector computes the [Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)](http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.feature.html#skimage.feature.blob_log) images with successively increasing standard deviation and stacks them up in a cube. Blobs are local maximas within this cube. Detecting larger blobs is slower because of larger kernel sizes during convolution. Bright blobs on dark backgrounds are detected."

[This PyTorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html) demonstrates how to train the classifiers. Image captioning is another application of such deep neural nets - [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Image-Captioning) walks us through how to do image captioning with pytorch. Object Detection and Scene Classification are other ways deep neural nets are used for images - [this PyTorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/torchvision_tutorial.html) demonstrates Object Deteciton, and there are multiple ([1](https://github.com/buptchan/scene-classification), [2](https://github.com/ran337287/MRCNN-for-Scene-Classification), [3](https://github.com/zanilzanzan/FuseNet_PyTorch)]. Another popular open source image object detector is [UC Berkeley's caffe library](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org) of trained and trainable neural nets written in C++. (Check out the [python api](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/python/caffe/pycaffe.py)). Scene classifiers can be built on top of caffe, such as MIT's [Places](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/demo.html). \n",

Model inference (which is when we use a model to either make a class prediction or embed an image in a high dimensional space), however, doesn't take so long, and we can make use of powerful pre-trained models to help us in our content analysis.\n",
